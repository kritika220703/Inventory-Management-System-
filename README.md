# Inventory-Management-System-

An Inventory Management System (IMS) is a comprehensive framework designed to oversee and optimize the entire lifecycle of a business's inventory. By seamlessly integrating various database tables, such as WAREHOUSE, CATEGORY, ITEMS, W_MAP, and others, the system facilitates precise tracking of product details, supplier relationships, and transactional data. Through efficient management of stock levels, order processing, and strategic forecasting, an IMS plays a pivotal role in enhancing operational efficiency, minimizing costs, and ensuring a seamless flow of goods within the supply chain. This schema provides a structured foundation for organizing and controlling inventory-related activities within a business entity.
